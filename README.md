# MyReads Project


### Project Overview

This is a Project of the [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree with Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).
The goal of this app is to let users keep track of books. Users are able to sort books through the different shelfs, which are: "currently Reading", "read" and "want to read". There is also a search page where users can search for books (limited Books). The search Page is access by the green '+' icon in the bottom right corner.

For this project students are provided with static CSS and HTML markup and are required to implement React components in order to complete the project.

A list of all the requirements to complete the project is here: [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/918/view)

4. Type npm install to install app dependencies.
5. Type npm start to run the app.
6. The app will run on http://localhost:3000/.

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, Udacity provided a backend server. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods required to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
